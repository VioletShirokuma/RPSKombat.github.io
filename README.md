<h2>Description:</h2>

The information for the user on the game page will populate via the user information entered through the Github API on the login screen. The app will then take you to the Start screen where you are then lead to the game to play Rock, Paper, Scissors. The first user is all user-controlled, you can select your "Weapon" and click "3...2..1..Shoot!" in which the app processes resulting in a Win, Loss, or Tie - the second player's weapon choice is randomized which is pitted against the first player, and their Wins, Losses, or Ties gets entered into the database. Playing this game is a great way to pass time, to tally scores, make bets, etc.


<h2>Utilizations:</h2>

* MySQL

* Jquery

* Passport


<h2>Successes & Challenges:</h2>

- Successes: 
I felt with the little times we had to come together as a group, we managed to pull our own weights in spite of class not being in-person. There were some minor complications with routing and CSS but these were all easily smoothed over and everything we wanted to make and purpose, ended up functioning very well.

- Challenges: 
There is a lot more I feel we could have implemented -- our original ideas were to implement a leaderboard to be linked on all the HTML pages, that would be tracked within the database as well. Using an additional API route or creating more complicated API routes took up a lot of time, so we didn't go through with that. I personally tried to implement a different framework but realized it was taking up way too much of my own time and therefore stuck to what we coded out.


<h2>Future Development:</h2>
- I would have liked to add additional functions the app, as well as make it more dynamic by adding audio and sound effects, to simulate more of a video game feel.
